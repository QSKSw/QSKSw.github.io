<br>

Due to cancer-induced brain damage, I have extreme difficulty thinking clearly in high temperatures.<br>
I live in a desert and don't have much time where the temperature ISN'T nauseatingly high.<br>
As such, the commentary I provide on this YouTube channel can be very... unspeakably awful.<br>
For the most part it adds to the entertainment value,<br>
but occassionally I will say something deeply offensive, maybe even oppressive.<br>
I'm not trying to excuse or justify my behaviour, merely to provide warning.<br>
I am very, very sorry for anything hurtful I may say.<br>
If asked I will apologize to those affected, personally.<br>
<br>
I only do this commentary as a favor to my friends,<br>
and because otherwise I would have no source of income.<br>
Finding a job is hard.<br>
<br>
I am in the process of moving to a cooler climate,<br>
where hopefully I will be able to control myself better.<br><br>
