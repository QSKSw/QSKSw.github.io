<center><h1>Infinimart</h1></center>

"Infinimart" is a game about searching for your lost grandmother in an infinitely generating department store, the idea for which was initially created jointly by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Vahkiti">Vahkiti</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JonahEadie">Fishspill</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/QSKSw">QSKSw</a>. Creative differences have prevented the game from proceeding past the design phase. As of this writing Infinimart is to be an isometric first-person rouge-like free-world sandbox RPG mini-games collection with or without intrusive cutscenes.
