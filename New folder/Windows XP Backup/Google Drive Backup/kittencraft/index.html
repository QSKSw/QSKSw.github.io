<h1>Kittencraft</h1>

<p>

Kittencraft is a mod headed by QSKSw under the pseudonym <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Catgirl_Notch">"Catgirl Notch."</a><br>
Original intent was to add Cats to survival-horror sandbox game Minecraft.<br>
Catgirl Notch was unable to add Cats before Minecraft's official developers.<br>
The cats they added were cooler than anything we could have done anyway.
