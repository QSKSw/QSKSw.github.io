My favorite color is pink and my favorite color combination is pink and black. I am a Hardcore Retro-Gamer and my favorite video games are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockraidersunited.org/wiki/index.php?title=Rock_Raiders_PC_Game">Lego Rock Raiders.</a> My favorite animal is Cats and I currently have one pet cat, a black and white American Short-hair named Tutter, after the mouse from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_in_the_Big_Blue_House">Bear in the Big Blue House</a> for reasons that I no longer remember. The first online forum that I was a part of was the <a target="_blank" href="https://community.lego.com/">Lego.com Message Boards</a> followed by several forums based on Lego toy franchises, most frequently a forum based on the Bionicle line. I authored a Bionicle-based sprite comic on said forum for two years. At the same time I administrated my own forum which is currently defunct. Years later I would manage and administrate over a small Minecraft server until it too eventfully went defunct. I have held paying jobs as a video commentator, a bus station attendant and gift-shop sales clerk, a video game sales person, and washing meteorites. I currently work as a freelance graphics artist for various independent game projects and pro-bono work for various other parties, in addition to developing my own game that I have not unveiled to the public at this time. I have also been planning a video review series ala <a target="_blank" href="http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/">That Guy With The Glasses</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://rvtentertainment.com/">ReviewtopiaTV</a>.

"N/A"

<br><br><hr>

<p>I am a woman. Specifically, I am a transgender woman. This does NOT mean that I am "really a man." I have always been a woman and I have never not been a woman. If you think that I am not a woman because you have seen me and do not think that I "look" like a woman, or because somebody who is not me has told you that I am not a woman or that they think that I am not a woman, than that person is wrong, and you are wrong. It is not an opinion that I am a woman and it is certainly not something that can be disagreed with. If you, on-purpose and consistently, choose to refer to me as a man and treat me as a man whether jokingly or in all seriousness, I will not appreciate it, I will not respect you, I will not work for you, I will refuse to have anything to do with you. Being a woman has nothing to do with your body or what genitals you have, regardless of what you were "taught" or what you think you were taught in high school Biology class. Being a woman but having a penis does not automatically make you a "male woman" or whatever terminology you decide fits. Being a woman and being female is purely a matter of identity, of feeling, of self, of mind. I am a woman. A female woman. I am a female woman who is female and a woman. And if you think I am asking you to pity me for this you are also wrong. I do not regret who I am. I do not need or want pity for who I am. All I am doing here is stating facts, that people apparently need explained to them, repeatedly, over and over again.</p>
