<font color="FF0000">Since writing this I have remembered various other mental disorders I have that do not normally come into focus. Also I have since learned the distinction between a mental disorder and a mental disabilitity. This entire section needs to be re-written but due to the thermal intolerance disability mentioned I have been unable to get around to it. This is also the reason why I have not actually written the rest of this page yet.</font>

I had a Cystic Cerebellar Astrocytoma brain tumour when I was three years old. Complications with it's removal to this day cause me to have great difficulty in focusing and higher thought in temperatures about 75 degrees Fahrenheit without a considerable amount of pained effort, escalating to frequent vomiting at temperatures above 85, and tendency towards passing out at above 95. Because I currently live in a desert, this condition is nearly crippling. A medical shunt was implanted but to this day the tubing causes me intense pain in the entire right side of my body that was apparently so great that I trained myself to become left handed. This combined with motor skill impairment from the brain tumour and flat feet has made it very difficult for me to walk comfortably. Therapists have said that I may have Asperger syndrome or some other form of high functioning Autism but the symptoms could be easily caused by impairment of brain function from the tumour, as could the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or Attention Deficit Disorder I also seem to have. I also clearly have some kind of anxiety disorder and paranoia. Confusion in the fields of medicine and medical science has prevented me from getting much clarity on what disorders and psychosis I actually have and as such I have never been diagnosed to have anything other than flat feet and formerly a brain tumour. Also a prominent droop in my left eye which doctors say is unrelated to the brain tumour but they have no idea what is causing it. Similarities to my avatar are actually coincidental, as I started using the bleeding eye imagery before the eye droop emerged.
