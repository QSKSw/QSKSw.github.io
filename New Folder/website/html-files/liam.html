I am a recurring Guest Commentator on the webshow you are about to watch.<br>
I am not present for every episode, so be aware of that.<br>
Commentary is delivered live, so I will more often than not be very incoherent due to my <a href="../about/">disabilities</a> and environment.<br>
If any of my commentary irritates or offends, I would like to preemptively apologize here.<br>
