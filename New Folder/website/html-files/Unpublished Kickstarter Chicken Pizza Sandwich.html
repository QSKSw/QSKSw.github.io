I desperately needed money to pay rent at the time, and there was that Potato Salad Kickstarter going on, so I figured I could jump on the bandwagon. KickStarter apparently can't accept my bank account, so that didn't work. I'm still alive, so obviously every worked out in the end.

<b>I am making a chicken sandwich with pizza in it because <a href="" title="This link will not be included in the KickStarter"><font color="FF0000">potato salad</font></a>.</b>

<br>

<br>Support me in my goals to make a sandwich.

I was really hungry once and all I had was a frozen chicken sandwich and some week old left over pizza so I combined the two and created a pizza chicken sandwich. It was very soggy and tasted of age and death. Overall not very good. I swore to one day recreate this masterpiece of human ingenuity with higher quality ingredients.

<br><br>

I see now that KickStarter is interested in funding the creation of food products to be ingested once by a single person and never made again, so I am taking this opportunity to breathe new life into the great myth of our time.

<br><br>

<b>Goal #1: $1.08 for a chicken sandwich.</b> In my illustrious history of poverty, I have partaken in many fine inexpensive chicken sandwiches. I have decided that for the rebirth of the Pizza Chicken Sandwich, either the <b>McDonalds Buffalo McChicken</b> or <b>Burger King Spicy Crispy Chicken Jr</b> will suffice. If our goal is surpassed, I will mayhaps use both. A Pizza Double-Chicken Sandwich, if you will.

<br><br>

<b>Goal #2: Approximately $5 for a pizza.</b> What is that, you may be asking yourself. $5? For that which is our lord Giant Robot in the Sky's gift to humanity? Be wary my dear reader, for I have not given in to the madness just yet. In my travels, I have discovered that as long as you do not leave it in the refrigerator for a week, pizza is practically impossible not to be delicious. Chicken I have found can, and has, been sullied by the poor quality control of a certain taco establishment which hails from the same region as I, thus the need for the addition 8 cents applied to our poultry pound. But with pizza, there is no need for extravagance. There is no good pizza, or bad pizza. <b>Pizza just is.</b> I will be using the work of Julius <b>"Lil" Caesar</b> himself, in constructing our masterpiece of a sandwich.

<br><br>

<b>Stretch Goal #1: Additional $565.40, See Risks and Challenges.</b>

<br><br>

<b>Stretch Goal #3: Additional approximate $3 for Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Sauce.</b> Both of the chicken sandwiches I plan to possibly use in our endeavor possess suitable spice for my palate, but the addition of Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Sauce would propel us into greatness. The Pizza Chicken Sandwich is already a legend in it's own right, but now it would become a <b>suprelegend.</b>

<br><br>

<b>Stretch Goal #4: Additional approximate $12,000 for me to find a new and better place to live,</b> so that I may enjoy our sandwich in the magnificent abode a sandwich so as this deserves.

<br><br>

<b>Stretch Goal #5: Additional approximate $25,000 for gender reconstructive surgeries and hormone replacement therapy,</b> which would alleviate my <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QCuNkpg.jpg"><font color="#0094FF">shocking and disturbing appearance</font></a>, and improve the viewing experience of the private video provided to $10 backers of myself eating the Pizza Chicken Sandwich.

<br><br>

<b>Stretch Goal #6: Additional appoximatte $60 for feline cosplay and a ball of yarn.</b> These items will be used to further improve the viewer's viewing experience as I eat our delicious sandwich.

<br><br>

<b>Stretch Goal #9 million:</b> I don't know how much it costs, but I could make a <a href="http://qsksw.webs.com/games/"><font color="#0094FF">video game</font></a> about Pizza Chicken Sandwich I guess. I don't know.

<br><br>

<b>Stretch Goal #G: Approximately 13 trillion dollars: Irradication of all insect life on Earth</b> to further improve dining experience of not only the Pizza Chicken Sandwich, but all sandwiches, everywhere.

<h1>Risks and challenges</h1>
I am disabled, unhirable, and currently have no source of income until Social Security approves me for disability benefits. My caretaker spent the last month of their work year in the hospital and will not be receiving proper payment from their employers during a majority of their occupation’s off season. I have no way to pay rent and will possibly be evicted if I do not have $565.40 by July 10th. This KickStarter is just about the sandwich. I'm just letting you know, this is kind of a big risk or challenge to our noble cause.
